# list-of-utilities
This repository is created by me for saving the list of frequently used utilities.

[NAPS2](https://github.com/cyanfish/naps2) - scanner app with options to export scanned image(s), doc(s) to PDF, JPEG and other formats. Has a lot of setting and much better than standalone Windows Scanner App or in-built Ubuntu app for scanning
[pdf-to-jpg](https://github.com/KubaSzostak/pdf-to-jpg) - CLI tool to efficiently convert PDF to JPG
